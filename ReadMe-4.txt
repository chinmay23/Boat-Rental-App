Project:
	1. I enjoyed developing this project. 
	2. I developed an interactive application to rent a boat for one day. We offer same-day booking, no pre-bookings. Therefore, reach early and book your boat through our app. 
	
I tried my best to cover below-required fields :
	1. Code is functional and runs without errors. 10 points
	2. Strategy/approach to the project. 5 points
	3. Includes at least 5 custom functions, at least 2 functions to include parameters. 15 points
	4. Include at least 2 different custom classes (excludes DB base). 10 points
	5. Include comments inline to document the code. 10 points
	6. Include saving/retrieving data from a database. 20 points
	7. Use inheritance with your classes (excludes DB base as this was already provided). 15 points
	8. Include an interactive menu/program to run your project. 15 points
	

Files: DataInteraction.py (holds the interaction of code with the database) and DataManipulation.py (holds actual database code)
Project Path: 
	a. Place the above files in the root folder of your project.
	b. Follow the interactive commands to insert/retrieve/delete the data into the database
	c. You can interact as an admin as well as a customer.
	d. Admins:
		1. If existing admin, you need to log in using your password. P.S.: Passwords are currently stored in plain text in the database but eventually can be hashed.
		2. If new admin, enter your name and other details in addition to your password.
	e. Customer,
		1. If an existing customer, enter your customer ID.
		2. If a new customer, enter your details and get your customer ID.
